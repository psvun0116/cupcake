        <p class="aboutus"> A little about us. I started traveling the world trying all different types of fruits. I ended up staying with a buddy in France who loved the joy of baking. One evening as he taught me how to bake, I thought to myself of all those fruits I have tried along my travels. I asked him if it were possible and he said anything is possible if you put your mind to it. We not only experimented but we mastered the fine art of baking with deliciousness. </p>
